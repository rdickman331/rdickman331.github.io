title: About the Project

##Origin
KU Acts of Kindness is a Digital Humanities Project based out of the University of Kansas (Lawrence). It was developed as part of a project in a graduate-level Introduction to Digital Humanities course (DH690) under the instruction of Professor Élika Ortega.

##Purpose
The purpose of KU Acts of Kindness is to raise an awareness of the small acts of positivity and kindness that occur on KU's campus that may go unnoticed or ignored. In this way, its purpose is to foster an environment of good will and generosity in a setting which the media often portrays as largely negative or hostile. The final project will exist in the form of a static website designed by the project members.

##Audiences
As its purpose may suggest, the audiences for KU Acts of Kindness are varied. On one hand, the project lends itself to an academic audience, those who are accustomed to viewing the world through a critical lens. On the other hand, the project is such that it can be of value to the general public who may receive a biased picture of the academy or university culture that fails to acknowledge positive acts, focusing instead on only acts of violence or hate. Although negative acts such as these should in no way be ignored, we believe that KU Acts of Kindness can bring to light the everyday positive acts of positivity which mainstream media may otherwise fail to acknowledge. As such, the project is for everyone.

##Contributors
Acts of kindness are regularly observed on KU’s campus and recorded by the project members. However, we encourage submissions of kind acts by anyone who experiences or observes them at the university. Students, faculty, staff, and visitors are encouraged to follow KU Acts of Kindness on Twitter @KUKindness) and tweet their observances to the @KUKindness Twitter feed.
