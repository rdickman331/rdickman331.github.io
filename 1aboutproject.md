##Origin
KU Acts of Kindness is a Digital Humanities Project based out of the University of Kansas (Lawrence). It was developed as part of a project in a graduate-level Introduction to Digital Humanities course (DH690) under the instruction of Professor Élika Ortega.

##Purpose
The purpose of KU Acts of Kindness is to raise an awareness of the small acts of positivity and kindness that occur on KU's campus that may go unnoticed or ignored. In this way, its purpose is to foster an environment of good will and generosity in a setting which the media often portrays as largely negative or hostile. The final project will exist in the form of a static website designed by the project members. 

In its final version, the argument our site intends to convey involves the affective nature of this kind of mapping, also the affective nature of kindness itself. What our project teaches is that kindness is a subjective notion, one interpreted differently by different individuals. This subjectivity and affectiveness became especially apparent in the recording of kind acts, for what one observer considers "kind" may differ from another. Similarly, the days and moments when we are more likely to consciously recognize kind acts may shift and change. Our project both encourages this kind of subjectivity and allows us to see it represented in mapped form. We see this project as a nice balance between the data-based digital realm and the humanities fields that we three belong to. For more information on the concept of affective mapping, visit the "theory" page.

##Audiences
As its purpose may suggest, the audiences for KU Acts of Kindness are varied. On one hand, the project lends itself to an academic audience, those who are accustomed to viewing the world through a critical lens. On the other hand, the project is such that it can be of value to the general public who may receive a biased picture of the academy or university culture that fails to acknowledge positive acts, focusing instead on only acts of violence or hate. Although negative acts such as these should in no way be ignored, we believe that KU Acts of Kindness can bring to light the everyday positive acts of positivity which mainstream media may otherwise fail to acknowledge. As such, the project is for everyone.

##Contributors
Acts of kindness are regularly observed on KU’s campus and recorded by the project members. However, we encourage submissions of kind acts by anyone who experiences or observes them at the university. Students, faculty, staff, and visitors are encouraged to follow KU Acts of Kindness on Twitter (@KUKindness) and tweet their observances to the @KUKindness Twitter feed.
