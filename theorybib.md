	abstract = {The article discusses the role of geographic information system (GIS) in obtaining historical and cultural information about various regions of the world. It cites examples of Indianapolis, Indiana and Taipei, Taiwan, emphasizing the integration of multiple data-sets within a set of common geographies. The first citation involves the creation of a dynamic and scaleable mapping environment to manage and display data of the Indianapolis area, while the other involved 3-D projection of aerial photographs to stimulate the memory of the native villagers regarding past practices and discriminations, hence creating a landscape of memory. It is stated that the technology results in the fusion of qualitative and quantitative data and gives an alternative view of history and culture.},
